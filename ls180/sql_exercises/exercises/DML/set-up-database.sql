-- Set Up Database
-- For this set of exercises we'll want to create a new database and some tables to work with. The theme for the exercise is that of a workshop. Create a database to store information and tables related to this workshop.

-- One table should be called devices. This table should have columns that meet the following specifications:

-- Includes a primary key called id that is auto-incrementing.
-- A column called name, that can contain a String. It cannot be NULL.
-- A column called created_at that lists the date this device was created. It should be of type timestamp and it should also have a default value related to when a device is created.
-- In the workshop, we have several devices, and each device should have many different parts. These parts are unique to each device, so one device can have various parts, but those parts won't be used in any other device. Make a table called parts that reflects the information listed above. Table parts should have the following columns that meet the following specifications:

-- An id which auto-increments and acts as the primary key
-- A part_number. This column should be unique and not null.
-- A foreign key column called device_id. This will be used to associate various parts with a device.

CREATE DATABASE workshop;

CREATE TABLE devices (
  id serial PRIMARY KEY, 
  name text NOT NULL,
  created_at timestamp DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE parts (
  id serial PRIMARY KEY,
  part_number integer UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  device_id int REFERENCES devices (id)
);
