Requirements
The objective is to build a loan calculator application using the same approach as used for the dice rolling app from the previous assignment.

The APR should be set at 5%, but the loan amount and loan duration should be variable, to be passed to the application via the query string, e.g. http://localhost:3000/?amount=5000&duration=10
You can use the same formula from the assignment in the Programming Foundations with JavaScript course to calculate the monthly payment
The application should return the following, in plain text to be displayed on separate lines, to the browser:
The loan amount, in dollars
The loan duration, in years
The APR, as a percentage
The monthly payment, in dollars
